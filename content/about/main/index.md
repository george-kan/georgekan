Daniel King does his best to make the flow of quite complex games understandable to us mere mortals. He gives excellent expalantions of the games, strategy, 
plans as well as practical advice drawn from his experience (he is a GM) about which positions are difficult to play despite the computer evaluation.

Sam Copeland offers great analyses to many recent and old games. His best of the decade (for all the decades!) series is great and gives a clearer understanding 
of how the players viewed the game, what the theory was at that time and how the perspective for the same positions has changed since then also with the help of 
computers.

Two brothers (Cam and Brendan) try to improve various aspects of their lives: Sports, focus, reading speed, calisthenics abilities, losing body fat, you name it!
They have a very entertaining way of describing their plan, difficulties and showing how the overcome them. My only question is always how do they gain the weight 
back after their workout challenges but I think it comes down to sweets <span> &#128516; </span>
