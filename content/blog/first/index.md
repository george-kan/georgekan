title: My first blog post
---

This is the second time I create a blog. My first try was mainly focused on creating a repository to showcase my data science work but over time I realised that 
this is not the only thing I enjoy doing. While I do like to constantly learn and develop, data science was not the only area where I wanted to focus 
on. Therefore, I took the decision to take more control of my blog, add more categories to it in order to be able to share more content that I find interesting.

My blog is based on [Hugo Ap√©ro](https://hugo-apero.netlify.app/), a really nice Hugo theme created by Alison Hill. Setting it up took some considerable effort
as my web development skills are essentially non-existent. But I have enjoyed the process and learnt a few tricks on the way.

Content-wise I want to try to add something new every week. I realise there is a pretty high chance I will not manage to reach that goal but I do think that 
while a stretch goal, it can be done. So welcome and I will try to keep you entertained!
